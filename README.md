# Unbounce Scripts

Unbounce requires snippets of plain javascript (wrapped in a `<script>`) to pass tracking parameters when linking to IWA.

These snippets are called from Unbounce via `src` property of script tag.

NOTE: impact-click-id embedded script is working as expected.  get-referral-session-id is not working, and unbounce is hosting the full script
there is a test page called Josh Referral Test where we're trying to get it working.
